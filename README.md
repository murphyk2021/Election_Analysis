# Module 3:  PyPoll with Python
## An Introduction to Python 
- - - 
## Overview of Project
In this module students were asked to help Tom with the task of sorting through over 360,000 ballots to determine the winner of a congressional election in Colorado.  Although e could have used Excel to achieve this task, it was much easier and more efficient to instead use Visual Studio Code (so we can save and edit our code more easily) and learn the basics of Python. There are many similarities between the Python language and VBA, but there are also many differences that needed to be discussed and practiced during this exercise.  During this module we learned:
- how to create and manipulate lists and dictionaries,
- the order of operations of mathematical equations, 
- more about loops and conditionals,
- how to access a .csv, .xls, .txt file,
- how to write to a .txt file
